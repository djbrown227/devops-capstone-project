**As a** customer support agent  
**I need** to be able to read customer account information  
**So that** I can provide customers with accurate and timely support regarding their account details.

### Details and Assumptions
* The microservice already has a database containing customer account information, including names and addresses.
* The service provides an API endpoint to access this information.
* Authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to ensure data security.

### Acceptance Criteria     
**Given** a customer's unique account ID  
**When** I send a request to the 'read account' API endpoint  
**Then** I receive the requested customer account information, including their name and address, if the account exists and I have the necessary permissions.
